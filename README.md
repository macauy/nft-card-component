# Frontend Mentor - NFT Preview Card Component

This is my solution to the [NFT preview card component challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/nft-preview-card-component-SbdUL_w0U) on Frontend Mentor.

## 📌 Purpose

I built this project to practice **Tailwind CSS**. I focused on learning utility classes, layout, spacing, hover states, and responsiveness.

Because this was a styling exercise, I tried to follow the original design as closely as possible, but **some colors and measurements may differ slightly**, especially where Tailwind's default palette was used.
